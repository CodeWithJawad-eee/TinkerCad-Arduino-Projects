This repository showcases a collection of beginner-to-intermediate level Arduino and microcontroller-based mini-projects. These projects explore fundamental concepts in electronics, sensor integration, and embedded systems programming using platforms like Arduino Uno and ATtiny85. The aim is to provide hands-on learning experiences with practical implementations of real-world scenarios.

âœ¨ Key Highlights
Sensor Interfacing: Worked with analog and digital sensors such as temperature sensors, PIR motion detectors, IR remotes, and ultrasonic sensors to collect and process environmental data.

Actuator Control: Controlled various actuators like servo motors, RGB LEDs, buzzers, and LCD displays based on sensor input or user interaction.

Input Devices: Used keypads, push buttons, and potentiometers to interact with the microcontroller.

Signal Processing: Processed analog readings using scaling, conversion formulas (e.g., Celsius to Fahrenheit), and control logic.

PWM and LED Effects: Created fading LED effects using PWM and visual feedback based on temperature or distance thresholds.

Communication and Debugging: Utilized the Serial Monitor for debugging, data logging, and real-time observation of sensor outputs.

Microcontroller Variants: Some projects are built using ATtiny85, emphasizing low-power, compact design approaches for minimal hardware applications.

These projects are well-suited for students, hobbyists, and beginners looking to build a solid foundation in embedded systems, and they provide excellent practice in both hardware setup and software development.
